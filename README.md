# Challenge - Build a Basic Gallery Component (Vue)

## The Task

Using Vue, create a simple sliding gallery/carousel component.

Use the data found in './src/data/gallery.js' to create multiple instances of it on the page.

## Expected Behaviour

- Gallery should transition with a sliding effect
- Gallery should support previous/next paddle controls
- Gallery should support dot navigation indicating number of available slides and the current index
- Gallery should wrap and loop indefinitely

## Resources

- View './resources/basic-gallery-example.png' for an example of what is expected. You can either style the gallery to match the wires here, or opt for your own, but all of the elements should be included.
